Our route continues along the Lehamite Creek trail with moderate up and down throughout the day before dropping down to our camp at Snow Creek promontory. Here we are surrounded with spectacular views of Mt Watkins and Half Dome. This campsite offers an abundance of open skis so plan on enjoying a night of stargazing following dinner. The day's mileage is about 9 miles with ups of 1800' and downs of 1200'.\n\nDay 3: After breakfast, we'll head down the Snow Creek Falls trail to Mirror Lake and Yosemite Valley (5 miles and a 2700' down).

The Photographers that you arranged for our workshops were extremely helpful. Each one had his own take on photography and really helped in my pictures. The workshops I have taken in the past really don't even compare. They were geared around the instructors getting great images and not the students. Sure, they take you to great spots, but that's it..They don't even measure up to the photographers that you have on staff. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were more concerned with the training the students than themselves.\nNina and I really enjoyed our session with Phil. The methods he showed us on taking abstract photographs were really new thing for me, but I have some really unique and fascinated images for my wall.\nWhen we spent time with Walter Flint (two days), I really was skeptical. But, he rubbed off on me and I slowed down considerably. In the past, I would just photograph every little thing I would see. I would take a thousand images and none of them would be great. Some would be Good, but not great. After spending time with Walter, I really slowed down. I didn't take as many images, but they\u2019re great!\nOur last workshop with Robb Hirsch was even better. Robb was so helpful in every way possible. He helped me in creating some amazing images that I didn't expect from myself. I learned just as much from him as the other instructors, but in a different way. He spent time teaching me more about composition than I even imagined. And, I am really proud of myself and the images I created!\nOnce again, thank you for all your help! Thanks again for a wonderful experience!\n","seller":true,"id":"4f9a225e536e864d0e000012"}],"seller":{"id":"4f232d4d536e86d503000000"},"status":1,"updated":"2012-11-22T19:04:36+00:00","visible":true,"id":"4f3af72a536e860a10000000"},{"category":"Parachuting","complete":true,"currency":"USD","desc":"Tandem skydiving is the safest and easiest way to make your first skydive. \n\nFeel the wind between your toes!

It was a great feeling and the rush that you get from it so hard to explain I was literally speechless when we landed. And of course to top it of we land on the beach, during a local high school senior ditch day! LOL it was great to get an applause when you land from those watching.\n\nThis was a great experience and when I go again I know I will enjoy every last bit...","seller":true,"id":"4f87a2dc536e869e1d000026"},{"name":"Kim S.","email":"","review":"From start to finish, my cousin, his friends and I were provided with beyond excellent customer service in preparation for and through our jump.  Being a first timer, I had many questions, which Volker and Lisa promptly and thoroughly addressed via email.\n\nJump day was gorgeous.  We couldn't have asked for more perfect weather.  68 and not a cloud in sight?  In Cali?  This must be love.  We had a scheduled 1p.m. jump, which we were told would be pushed out by about 45 minutes due to a delay in schedule.  This was a bummer as it only seemed to build the slight anxiety I was feeling, but nonetheless, it was nice that the staff communicated the delay.\n\nI jumped with Matt- who was so cool and laid back.  He could sense my nervousness, and still remained very calm and explained all that I needed to do to make it the best experience.  He definitely made me feel at ease.\n\nI wasn't nearly as nervous as I imagined I'd be, especially when it came time to stick both legs outside the plane.  Matt was in charge of actually pushing us out the door, a factor that I was most appreciative of, since if it were up to me, I'm fairly certain that I would have had second thoughts at that moment.\n\nFree falling was an amazing experience.  Absolutely amazing.  Wind in your face at 120 miles per hour, minus the feeling that in all actuality, you're really falling straight down to the earth- such an awesome experience.  Once the parachute had opened, we were able to get beautiful views of the coast, a whole different experience from the free fall.  Matt showed me how to control the 'chute to do a few spins, and also showed me the feeling of \"zero gravity.\"  And what could be more perfect than landing barefoot on the beach?  \n\nGet the video and the photos- if not both, then definitely at least one of them, especially if you are a first timer.  Nothing will ever compare to your first jump.  Once we got back, I waited about 25 minutes or so for them to compile all of the photos and put together my DVD.\n\nAll in all, my first jump was fabulous.  I definitely owe a huge amount of the wonderful experience to the awesome staff.  And I will hopefully be back again in the future.","seller":true,"id":"4f87a32d536e86951d000026"},{"name":"Stephanie S.","email":"","review":"Well...\n\nI went and did it again. It's becoming an obsession, really. For me, nothing comes close in comparison to that feeling of exhilaration that I get from skydiving. Call me an adrenaline whore, but I love it!\n\nSo, here I am yelping about my A-M-A-Z-I-N-G weekend in Santa Cruz (a weekend that included; skydiving, touristy type stuff and ocean\/beach frolic).\n\nYes, I survived my second jump, thanks to my tandem partner Brad.\n\nNo, this is not my first skydiving experience.\n\nUpon arriving, we watched a quick informational video and signed the standard zero liability paperwork.\n\nAfter all the paperwork, we we're told that we would be up in the air in 45 minutes.\n\nThere are snacks on site in case you need to grab a bite to eat (for a fee, of course). Plenty of indoor seating where you can watch videos of previous jumps. There's also an area outside where you can hang out and watch as the other jumpers return from the jump location.\n\nIf you've never been before, let me explain to you what you can expect. First of all, you don't jump on your own. You jump with a tandem instructor. He\/she is strapped on your back and are responsible for pulling the parachute open. Basically, you are just along for the ride and try not to pee\/poo\/vomit all over either you or your tandem partner!\n\nYour tandem instructor is your best friend.\n\nThe ride up in the tiny plane is a bit nerve-racking, but no worries... it's all part of the experience! It's okay to be nervous, because once you jump... it's pure adrenaline, heart  pounding thrills!\n\nTumbling out head first, flips, turns and free fall spins. Good times!\n\nOnce the parachute is deployed, you'll be able to gather your composure and take in the spectacular view.\n\nAs you get closer to landing, he\/she might ask you if you get motion sickness, or if you like roller coasters. That's your hint to prepare yourself for some spinning and tricky maneuvers.\n\nI recommend you splurge on the photo disc, you get some great shots that'll last you a lifetime, as well as give you bragging rights.\n\nThe (barefoot) beach landing and peaceful, breathtaking views of the ocean and beach were...\n\nastonishing, astounding, fabulous, fantastic, marvelous, miraculous, phenomenal, stupendous, unbelievable, wonderful and wondrous!\n\nThank you for an incredible, yet almost indescribable experience.\n\nI'm ready to go again!!!","seller":true,"id":"4f87a397536e869b1d00002e"},{"name":"Nicole W.","email":"","review":"I took my boyfriend and I for our 8 year anniversary today. This was our first time and we were scared out of our minds. The instructors were awesome I had Casper and he had Matt both made us feel as comfortable as possible.

I thought this would be a one time thing for me considering how scared I was but after I did it I definitely will do it again!\n\nThere was a little bit of a wait before and my ears hurt after he pulled the parachute because they were plugged up.

Bit of a contrast between the two experiences. The plane you jump out of is tiny here, and can only hold 4 passengers (2 tandem instructors + 2 customers). So if you come with a group of friends, you're going to be waiting on each other for quite a while.\n\nBut otherwise, it's a solid experience. Matt was my tandem instructor, and he was great. Since he knew I was interested in taking the AFF program to get my Class A certification, he went over a lot of details with me, and even let me use the toggles to steer, flare, etc.\n\nOne thing I like about the jump here actually, is that when you're buckled to your instructor, you will be entirely out of the plane before you jump. So the actual decision to leap out of the plane is your instructor's decision alone. Comparing that to my previous experience, this was a hell of a stress reducer since I just had to put my life into his hands. If I accidentally hit on his girlfriend at some point in the past, and he decided to unbuckle and toss me out of the plane, he's totally able to.\n\nBeach landing is crazy, with all the people hanging out and you landing right behind them. Feels like something out a Bond movie.

Santa Rosa, CA","email":"","review":"We thought the Kauai ATV trip was fab, and it was, but this beats it hands down. Ken & Kathy Smith are committed to giving you the best tour possible, geared towards what you want. \n\nThey're basically in the middle of nowhere on their huge ranch. You have a choice of an 8am or 1pm tour. We chose the 8am tour since it's cooler earlier in the day. No other tours were booked that day so we got a chance to know Ken & Kathy better than some will. \n\nWe started in the barn which Ken has turned into a casual museum of the area. Lots of the artifacts came from the ranch itself. Then we were fitted with helmets (much cleaner than the Kauai ATV ones, which we appreciated), dust masks, goggles, and gloves. We were offered the choice of fully automatic ATVs or ones you have to shift, but not clutch - we chose the later ones for the extra power & gear control. We started on a flat area with instruction & then headed out on the trail. They paced themselves to us, and while this was a technically more challenging course than the Kauai one, it was more fun, too. The ranch is gorgeous & the views go on for miles when you get to the top of the mountains. Boy is it dusty, but that's what you expect... \n\nAfter the trip you clean up a bit & head into the barn for a tri-tip lunch & all the fixings - yum. Kathy's family showed up & the nephews got to ride around the practice circuit. It felt like we were part of the family & I don't think we left until about 2pm to head home for a much needed shower. \n\nKathy took a bunch of pix - she's quite talented - and we look forward to seeing the pix - and for free, unlike Kauai where they charge you for the DVD of pix.

This is a professionally run company, with safety being an integral part of the touring packages. Ken and his assistants took us on exciting and fun trails through the Sierra\u2019s. My first ATV experience with Ken and his company was my first real ATV experience. On one other occasion in Mexico,\nwith a different company, I rode an ATV. I was only allowed to go up and down the same sand dune over and over on a poorly operating machine. On the other hand, Ken\u2019s ATVs were in top notch working condition,\nobviously well maintained. He and his assistants made sure we practiced and were comfortable on the ATV prior to riding on actual trails.\n\nThe trails we went on were challenging, but in a good way, enough excitement, but not dangerous. We saw beautiful country, different vegetation at different evaluations, scenic views, different geological formations,\nand interesting wildlife. At the end of my first trip I had the choice to go through a huge mud hole or not. I choose to do so. What a blast! And I was allowed to repeat this several times. I was not recognizable after all\nthis and I have the pictures to prove it. Ken took pictures of thrilling moments, such as the mud hole, which he provided to me as part of the package. I really had the time of my life!!!\n\nAfter the wonderful tour we were provided with towels, etc. to get cleaned up before being served a delicious barbecued meal with all the wonderful side dishes and great company.\n\nAfter the experience with Explore! Sierra Touring Company my husband and I went out and bought our own ATVs. We hope to continue the gratification we initially experienced while touring with Ken and his group.\n\nI personally highly recommend, in fact I endorse Ken and his company!!!\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if I can provide any additional information.","seller":true,"id":"4f95a15d536e86850e000001"}],"schedules":[{"departure":"fixed","times":[900,1300],"repeat":"weekly","days":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6],"priceDelta":0,"id":"511e20ef986ae5e023000020"}],"seller":{"id":"4f4197ce536e86582b000000"},"status":1,"updated":"2013-03-23T07:19:52+00:00","visible":true,"id":"4f419b43536e86794b000000"},{"addOns":[{"name":"Make Tour Private ","desc":"By adding this feature, you are making this tour private and closing it off to the public.","price":125,"id":"513fb65b3e269eda5a00001d"}],"category":"Trekking \/ Hiking","complete":true,"currency":"USD","desc":"Explore with us to make a lifelong connection with Yosemite National Park.

Since then, artists like Carlton Watkins, Edward Weston and Ansel Adams, to name a few, have been photographing the Yosemite Valley and High Sierra, all the while traveling to many meadows, peaks, river banks and vistas. On this tour, we will visit some of those vistas that established these artists as the great landscape photographers of their time, and which helped transform the American environmental movement.\n\nThis tour is appropriate for those shooting either black and white, or color photography, and will focus on a select number of locations from which these icons photographed Yosemite Valley. The tour will begin in the afternoon at the Church Bowl parking lot and picnic area -- where Adams shot two famous images-- and will conclude at Inspiration Point on the Wawona Road which can offer epic sunset opportunities. This tour will consist of discussions concerning depth of field, hyperfocal distance, exposure techniques, metering, the zone system, white balance, and composition. A generous portion of the discussion -- in conjunction with the aforementioned topics -- will be devoted to talking about the artists, their philosophies, histories and their eye for photography.\n\nPrograms are crafted by an expert photographer who will lead each session.

You have to be able to trust the person you're going to dangle off the bridge with and Dan was definitely the kind of guy worth trusting hands down. He took the time to not only convince me that it would be safe with his 100% perfect safety record over the last 2 decades, his checking and double checking his equipment, the thorough explanations as I called him 3 or 4 times to make sure I wasn't going to be saying hi to God the day of the jump (or the devil, since I'd love to start working on my drunken deviant merit badge). We met around 6:00 am the day of the jump about an hour before dawn. (January 7th the weekend after New Years, so as you can imagine it was freeze your balls off cold) He explained what me and my group would have to do in getting ready for our drunken kool-aide leap to our deaths. We geared up and one by one at sunrise started leaping into the abyss of the bridge to the amusement of passersby and hoary old fishermen under the bridge laughing their collective asses off. He even let me take pictures and video of the whole experience which like a photo taking fiend I made sure to capture every moment of the experience with all my friends jumping off the bridge and having the time of their lives. If you're interested in trying to cheat death yourself then you can go to Dan's site at: http:\/\/www.icarusbunge... and if you're interested in seeing the video I took of this insane bungee adventure you can see it at my little old Youtube page: http:\/\/youtu.be\/Htf8XL...\n\nIf you decide to go bungee jumping choose the man with the 100% safety record for 22 years, cheap rates, and who loves what he does and wants each person who jumps to love it as much as he does.

Kirk is a good guy, and he definitely knows his fish. Heck, he knows his arthropods and mollusks too, including the noble owl limpet, with its characteristic ventral locomotion. He seems to know everything about the ocean in fact, and talked at length about whatever she happened to be throwing at us that day. As we started towards the mud flats, he extemporized on the merits and edibility of sea lettuce unexpectedly strewn about the bay floor. When he dropped his clam pump mid-sentence and ran wildly back to the sand, shouting \"Stay there!\" and \"Don't go towards them!\" it was clear something fun and unexpected was up. A school (?) of maybe 8 leopard sharks had started lurking in the water not 10 feet from us, and he got us set with a shark catching rig while he resumed explaining the difference between male and female ghost shrimp and the methods of capture. The 3-hour tour is fun and dynamic. We even almost got stranded on a little rock island. Don't come expecting him to burn his secret spots for the best and tastiest morsels. Heck, the spots aren't even that secret (hint, I burned it in the second paragraph).

This is a professionally run company, with safety being an integral part of the touring packages. Ken and his assistants took us on exciting and fun trails through the Sierra\u2019s. My first ATV experience with Ken and his company was my first real ATV experience. On one other occasion in Mexico,\nwith a different company, I rode an ATV. I was only allowed to go up and down the same sand dune over and over on a poorly operating machine. On the other hand, Ken\u2019s ATVs were in top notch working condition,\nobviously well maintained. He and his assistants made sure we practiced and were comfortable on the ATV prior to riding on actual trails.\n\nThe trails we went on were challenging, but in a good way, enough excitement, but not dangerous. We saw beautiful country, different vegetation at different evaluations, scenic views, different geological formations,\nand interesting wildlife. At the end of my first trip I had the choice to go through a huge mud hole or not. I choose to do so. What a blast! And I was allowed to repeat this several times. I was not recognizable after all\nthis and I have the pictures to prove it. Ken took pictures of thrilling moments, such as the mud hole, which he provided to me as part of the package. I really had the time of my life!!!\n\nAfter the wonderful tour we were provided with towels, etc. to get cleaned up before being served a delicious barbecued meal with all the wonderful side dishes and great company.\n\nAfter the experience with Explore! Sierra Touring Company my husband and I went out and bought our own ATVs. We hope to continue the gratification we initially experienced while touring with Ken and his group.\n\nI personally highly recommend, in fact I endorse Ken and his company!!!\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if I can provide any additional information.","seller":true,"id":"4f6b4801536e86835c000003"},{"name":"Sher Humter","email":"sherryinreno@yahoo.com","review":"Our times  spent with you and your family were some of the best times we had during our time in Nevada.

Known to many Californians as a great whitewater rafting trip, the Middle Fork receives virtually no angling pressure in these pristine 16 miles of river, so the fishing is great if you can get access it. That is where we come in and guide you safely down the rapids and into the productive fishing waters. We guarantee that you will have one of the best fishing trips of your life. Our professional and licensed guides can take you to the hottest fishing runs on the river. Be prepared to catch and release many big beautiful Rainbows, Browns and the occasional Brook Trout. Our trips are 2 to 4 day wilderness style trips with gourmet cuisine. This is a truly remarkable and unique fishing trip.\n\nWe are dedicated to keeping our fishery strong so all trips are catch and release. As well, we fish with only single barb-less hooks to keep our trout beautiful without injuries or scars . Our guides will be happy to supply you with the proper hooks or pinch the barbs down on yours. We take all levels of fly fishermen and spin fisherman down this section, so all are welcome to come out and experience this amazing trip. We set the bar high, only having professional fishing guides with years of experience fishing these waters and waters alike. You will learn what to throw and what works the best for certain times of year on our trips as well. \n\nThe Middle Fork American is 16-25 miles (depending on length of trip) of pristine fishing waters. This river does have a few significant class rapids which keep most anglers out, but come with us and our guides will lead you down the rapids safely or walk you around them if you do not wish to partake in the whitewater part of the trip. All rapids are easily walked around and you can fish the banks while the boat navigates the rapid and meets you at the bottom.\n\nPricing:\nTwo Day - $595.00\nThree Day - $825.00\nFour Day - $945.00","duration":2880,"excerpt":"We offer two, three, and four day trips down this famous Northern California river.

Michael and his wife have become very good friends (close to family feeling) due to their kindness, hospitality, and beautiful country they live in. What a contrast to the concrete & freeways in my everyday world.\n\nGetting there\nYou can fly into Eureka, CA or Redding, CA, and it is 75 miles from either airport, or you can get a cheaper flight into Sacramento, and it is about a 4 hour drive from there. Use a separate GPS, not the one on your phone!!   After 10 visits, no, there's no cell reception, so your phone won't work. Using a separate GPS, punch in coordinates North 40.777475, West 123.332234. This will take you right to R&R's front door.   Yes, they are next to \"Del Loma RV Park\".\n\nWhat you'll need\nI agree with MissJennifer.  Everything is provided, except for water shoes. If you surf, booties are great, as the river water is cold. You'll also need sunblock, sunglasses (but you may lose these in the river, so nothing expensive), water bottle (stay hydrated), and camera (again, nothing expensive)\nAlso, chill out if your cell doesn't work. Use it as a great excuse to get away from your city life and hectic pace.\n\nRafting\nThe rafting is great! Go for the full day trip, and lunch is provided. The best time to go is during late March, early April, as the snow pack is melting.","seller":true,"id":"4f908715536e86b04d000035"},{"name":"Shirley F.-Twin Rivers School, Sacramento, CA.","email":"","review":"Thank you for the wonderful rafting experience.

It was all our first time going river rafting and even though the water level was low it was beautiful.  Michael makes amazing salmon jerky and the vegetables from their garden were fresh and tasty.  \n\nThey provided everything you need: life vests, wet suits, helmets, oars, etc.  However, you should bring your own water shoes.  The views were amazing, we saw a bald eagle, schools of salmon and other fish swimming up stream, water oozles (sp?).\n\nFinding this place was a little bit of a challenge.  It is literally right next to the RV park.  At first we drove 7 miles past it but we turned around and finally made our way there.  Don't count on your phone\/GPS for navigation because reception is hit or miss in the mountains.  \n\nI can't wait to come back here during peak rafting season when the water level is higher.

Doug, you are accurate; I did have my daughter take lessons before she came. I'm an over-cautious mom of a used-to-be more over-timid daughter who had some sensory challenges with gross motor planning and muscle coordination issues early in life. It has been a real hard balance to know when to push her and when to wait. I wanted to find a ranch experience where we could be together as a family and where I could see that she could take on new experiences but with kind, knowing, supportive guidance. I didn't think you could find that just anywhere, but we did find just that with you guys. I'd like to say that I am a genious for figuring out just the right spot for us, but it wasn't hard because your website accurately explains exactly what you are. You have done a wonderful job of relaying the ranch philosophy, emphasis on safety and ability for full inclusion. From my particular perspective, all of the activities are perfect for those of all activity levels who want to have a wonderful first time expanding their range of outdoor experiences. I can report now, three months later, that my daughter's self confidence grew from her experience and yet all she knows is that she had a wonderful time and made terrific friends. She gets emails from the friend she made from Dubai and has continued on in her horseback riding lessons. I am grateful for the terrific experience we had starting from the ride up the hill with Peter. \n\nAs for me, well, I felt like I had been dropped into a novel in a remote area with a beautiful, passionate, hardworking family. Each of the family members shared a bit of who they are and what is important to them. It was hard to leave and not know the next chapter about singing with a great mentor, future social work internships, the next year of school with the native american indians, etc. I was completely overwhelmed by the story of how you all worked so hard to turn your passions into a lifestyle. I have a high regard for all of you and a soft spot in my heart as well.

Well anyway we needn't have worried. It was everything we'd hoped for and more. Absolutely beautiful spot and absolutely lovely people.

You guys fitted the bill perfectly. Not sure we will ever be able to find a holiday that comes up to this level of all round enjoyment from when you wake up to when you finally collapse into bed. Not only were the activities spot on but so was the food. Heidi and the girls cooked up a feast at every meal so there was never any chance of us going hungry.

The caves to the South are filled with sea stars and vibrant algaes, while harbor seals relax on the rocks outside in their pure and natural environment. Natural channels protect from the wind and surf, making the paddling smooth and easy. \n\nTo the North, spectacular sandstone cliffs provide haven for conspicuous Black Oystercatchers who swoop down towards the water, screeching their arrival. Narrow coves and passageways lead over the clear blue green shallow water.

He was a great tour guide and a great teacher of wines. He took us to 4 wineries. Each winery tasting is $10 per person. Remember to \"revisit\"  a wine that you really like. Wineries are chosen based on what the group likes to drink so be sure to have an idea and Tom will take you where you want to go. There are approximately 400 wineries in the area and he has been to, by Tom's count, to over 200 of them. The bikes are well maintained and the ride is flat. If you have not ridden a bike in a long time be prepared for about 15 total miles of easy riding with maybe 3 to 5 miles between wineries. I would suggest that you not drink too much. Lunch is provided, which was very nice.

It is an 18 mile guided cruise around the dry creek valley.  The area is so lovely you can imagine you are in the South of France.  The guides are informative, fun, and even introduced us on how to wine taste properly.  You get your bike rental and helmet for the day, wine tastings, lunch and water for the day.  We were finished by about 3:30pm.  We started in a group of 6 people and they do have a van that follows the group in case anyone gets tired or purchases wine.  One lady hopped in the van after our first stop.

S.","email":"","review":"Had an awesome experience with Tahoe Sport Fishing.\nWhile in Tahoe on my honeymoon with the wife, we decided to spend a day on the lake and try to catch some fish. This place had the best reviews, so we made reservations and jumped on in.\nMost days they have two tours going out- a five hour tour in the am, and a four hour tour in the afternoon. We went in the afternoon and ended up going out with about 20 other people. Since they own a ton of boats, they split us up into groups of 5 or 6, and we were lucky enough to head out with Captain Zack on the Hopper III.\nThey provide everything for you on these charters, and you can even bring your own beer and snacks. I brought a backpack stuffed with cheese and crackers, chips, and of course cold beer. This made the afternoon even better. They do offer up lunch service on some of the charters, but I would just bring stuff from home to save yourself some cash and just bring some snacks.\nEveryone on board became friends rather quickly, and we all took the time to talk sports, America, and politics. All the while we were fishing, drinking beer, and just relaxing and enjoying a beautiful day on the beautiful lake. Another passenger caught the first fish about 20 minutes in. Then we just kept reeling 'em in.\nBy the end of the four hour tour, we had pretty much racked up our limit all around the boat. The Captain cleaned our fish for us, bagged 'em up, and let us know that there were three different restaurants in the area that would actually prep your food for you if you ate there. Since we had already eaten at MacDuff's and knew how awesome it was, we decided to go there. GREAT choice.\nAll around- awesome experience here. The Captain and staff were awesome. They provide everything you need for a great morning or afternoon on the water, and you're just about guaranteed to catch something. If not, you'll at least have a blast on the lake. Great times here.","seller":true,"id":"4f844a9b536e86971d00001c"},{"name":"Ian A.","email":"","review":"I have chartered a bunch of boats and this crew was great!  Capt.

Captain Zak and Garrett took care of baiting the poles for us and we trolled the afternoon away.\nI caught 2 lake trout and Charlie and Cindy from Houston, TX, caught the other 2 trout.

It was absolutely the best experience I could have hoped for and surpassed all of my expectations. The boat also is fantastic with the two awesome decks for viewing the Monterey Bay Wildlife (I guess it is the only tour in the area with a 2nd top deck, which was incredible).

There are snacks, hot coffee and hot coco, and you pay what you think is a fair price. Within 30 minutes, Kate, our naturalist spotted two killer whales. The boat then followed them for a distance.  The two whales got within feet from the boat. I seriously thought they could have just lifted the boat!  We all screamed with excitement. Kate, Tony (volunteer) and Jim (the captain) are wonderful. They made us feel really comfortable.  Tony kindly lent his jacket to someone didn't dress warmly enough -- it was cold on the sea. We spotted two humpbacks too. I've seen their signature tails on TV and other media so many times. But seeing the real thing for the first time in my life is totally different experience. Kate posted wonderful pictures and videos within hours after the trip.  Having read the reviews, I went prepared by taking motion sickness pills before hand. Still I felt sick to the stomach at some point.  Overall, I would highly recommend them. And I second to many other posts, please take motion sickness pills (such as Dramamine).\u201d","seller":true,"id":"4f7cd495536e86a21d000006"},{"name":"Alicia B.","email":"","review":"We had a great experience! The Captain, Naturalist, and crew are fantastic! They are knowledgeable, friendly, and create a very homey environment. The boat is nice and has a second story deck which provides an even better view (I heard this is one of the only boats in the area with a second story deck). The views of the Monterey Bay were phenomenal, especially since we went on a sixty + degree day. Be sure to bring a hat, gloves, and wind-proof jacket, because even on a warm day the wind made it slightly chilly. We saw two different groups of gray whales that we followed for a good period of time so we could observe their activities. While we didn't see any whales breach, we did see them fluke several times which was really neat!\n\nAfter reading several reviews, I was nervous that half the boat would get sea sick, but on the day we went out only one young lady got sick. The crew provided a \"free\" natural oil to all passengers to use before getting on the boat, which may have helped. The boat also offered passengers ginger ale, ginger tea, saltines, and other foods to help with sea sickness.\n\nThe boat ride to get out to whale watching area did seem to take a long time on the way there and back, but it was peaceful and relaxing.\n\nOne tip is to take $5 cash for parking. Another tip is to bring sunscreen, we forgot this key item and ended up with sunburns. I would definitely recommend this whale watching adventure, we are planning to go again in the summer season to see a different variety of whales.","seller":true,"id":"4f806544536e86971d000012"},{"name":"Joy B.","email":"","review":"Just went today for our first whale watching adventure and we loved it! First, their pricing is definitely reasonable.  In addition, they are very easy to find being right off the highway. The staff is very friendly. On our tour, we had 3 people (Captain, Naturalist\/Guide and a volunteer). Everyone was friendly and made the tour fun. The boat isn't brand new, but is a good size and in decent condition. I also really enjoyed the fact that you can bring your own food\/beverages onto the boat.\n\nNow for the important part - the sightings! As soon as we left the dock, we immediately saw hundreds of sea lions sunbathing. As we headed further out, we saw a porpoise and some sea otters scattered around. After about 30 minutes of cruising, we came across a large pod of dolphins.....and I mean large! There were at least a hundred and they were extremely active. They were splashing all over the place and swimming along the boat as we moved. It was truly amazing to be surrounded by these beautiful creatures. After this, we cruised for another 45 minutes or so looking for whales. We had some luck and spotted a gray whale. It was pretty far off and really hard to get a picture, but the crew was patient and turned off the engine to the boat so that we could sit and wait for the whale to surface again. We waited about 15-20 minutes and it surfaced a few times during that period. Each time, it was pretty far off, but we were able to get some shots of water coming out of its blow hole. After leaving there, we went to another location and found 2 more gray whales. Again, we couldn't get too close so it was still difficult to see. (There is a rule that the boats can't get to close - obviously for the safety of the whales.) I was just a bit disappointed because I was thinking the whales were going to breech really close to the boat (like all of the pictures on the website\/facebook, but as the crew always reminds you, these animals are wild, its completely unpredictable as to what will happen during your tour). I'm still glad that we got to see the whales, even if it was from a distance. (Although, I wasn't too worried because they offers a chance to come back if your current tour doesn't have any whale sightings.) So, I knew that even if I didn't see any whales today, I would definitely see them in the future.\n\nThe other great thing about all the whale watching companies is that they are all on the same radio frequency so whenever one boat sees something in the water, they communicate it to the others so that everyone can get to that same location and share in the experience. I would definitely go back again - maybe during humpback season or orca season!\n\nTip: They do leave right one time, so make sure you come early or you might get left behind!","seller":true,"id":"4f80661c536e86941d00000a"},{"name":"Tom R.","email":"","review":"Great day-  and we are going again this Sunday.\nThe ride was a little rough - but my 81-year-old mom spent most of the ride on the point of the bow.\nWe saw an amazing number of killer whales and a few dolphins.\nHunting packs and a couple of spyhoppers-  I could not have been more pleased.\nSnacks and beverages were available and on the honor system - pay what you feel appropriate.\nIt was a four hour ride - and it felt like they were kind of stretching toward to the end to make the time-  we came back very slowly, but on the whole a great time.","seller":true,"id":"4f80668c536e86931d00000d"},{"name":"Mike L.","email":"","review":"We went out on 6\/18 for my girlfriends birthday.

Moss Beach Ranch offers all of that, and more.  From rank beginners to advanced levels of competition, MBR has horses and ponies available for lessons and even lease opportunities.  There are a wide range of instructors available, as well as summer and vacation camps for kids (as well as some adventuresome adults!).  The ranch facilities are simple but safe, and all the horses and ponies are happy and well-loved.\n\nWhat I love most about this place, though, is the access to trails.  The ranch is situated on the border of the Montara Mountain open space, meaning you can literally ride for hours without seeing another human being.  What you will probably see instead is a coyote, or even a bobcat! You will also be treated to some of the most beautiful, classic California views imaginable...mountains rolling right down to the sea.  \n\nThe other thing that I love most (I can have more than one, right?!) is the people.  I had tried riding at a \"fancier\" show barn over in Portola Valley, and the people there were, by and large, your stereotypical snobby \"horsey set\" (or at least they liked to think of themselves that way!).  The people at MBR are real people, supportive, caring, and fun.  No one cares if you're wearing handmedowns and your horse's boots don't match.  Everyone is just there to have fun and enjoy themselves and a wonderful (lifestyle choice) sport. I am especially impressed by the kids there -- they are all excellent examples of how spending time working around horses builds independence, confidence, and responsibility in a young person.  \n\nThe other other thing I love most is the variety of training available -- lead trainer Jeanette Jacobi is wonderful with the little ones and is also refreshingly challenging for more advanced riders looking to move on and even compete. And, most amazingly, there is even a cross-country course, and the ranch hosts two schooling-level combined training events each year!  This is, in my opinion, the most fun thing you can possibly do with a horse -- but if competing is not your goal, the beach rides and camping trail rides are a pretty close second, in my opinion! \n\nI could keep going on and on, but the last thing I love the most about MBR is that it is exactly 30 minutes from my home in San Francisco, and the drive is beautiful and nearly always traffic-free; though even if it wasn't, it would be well worth it.","seller":true,"id":"4f8de649536e86ad4d000008"},{"name":"Pat C","email":"","review":"This is a wonderful place and just a quick drive down the coast.

The owner adopted him, paid for surgery to correct his lameness, and now he's a sweet beast living life in one of the most beautiful, temperate parts of the United States.  The horses here are not the (bless their hearts) zombies you find at other places.

This tour sounded like something we could all do together without the need for us all to be experienced bikers.\n\nThe staging area for the trip is in the police station parking lot in Calistoga so no worries about your vehicle being parked for the day. All the bikes were lined up and ready for selection. Bike sizes do vary so you may want to specify the bike size you want when booking or you may end up with one that is not the size you want. This was the only negative thing I could say about the set up.\n\nThe terrain was easy to navigate and in no way difficult. The winery's were very nice and there was ample time for tasting and relaxing. We were unable to tour one of the winery's listed in the program but the tour guide lined up a replacement vineyard that was great and actually more educational than the others. Any wine we bought during the tour was picked up by him at the end of the day and delivered to our vehicle area.\n\nOur guides name was Tommy and he was fantastic. We were never rushed or pressured to maintain any type of time line. He let us stay at each place as long as we wanted. He also grew up in the area and was able to tell us much of the history of the city and the valley, so that was cool. The lunch was very good and served on glass dishes, no paper plates used here.\n\nOverall I would recommend this tour to anyone looking for a casual way to visit the area, get a little exercise, and just try something different. It was very pleasant and gave you the opportunity to see the scenery at a different pace. ","seller":true,"id":"4f876aa2536e86961d00002b"},{"name":"K.

We decided to go kayaking on the Russian River. We had a fantastic time! We had a great guide, Michael, who was laid-back and a lot of fun. Because the river was very calm the day we kayaked, Michael was able to take us up and down the river to show us interesting birds without worrying about harsh winds or currents. He also gave us a lot of great information about the surrounding area.\n\nLunch was waiting for us at a picnic table. Michael had brought some sandwiches, vegetables and dip, potato salad, fruit, chips, and sodas. But before we ate, Michael took us down a path to nearby Goat Rock State Beach, where the last scene of Goonies was filmed!\n\nThe highlight of the trip was after lunch, when we kayaked towards the meeting point of the river and the Pacific. A colony of seals was camped out on the nearby rocks! Michael guided us a short distance away to avoid scaring them, since they were shy. But we got a great look at them, and one or two of the more curious ones even popped their heads up in the water behind our kayaks!\n\nAll in all, we really enjoyed the kayaking and would definitely do it again the next time we are in the area.

We chose the Pedal N Paddle tour, and it was so much fun!!! I wish I could afford to do it again. We rode our bikes to a couple of wineries, some of the wineries gave us free tours of the wine cellar, and we got to taste a lot of wine and then kayak afterwards! You can barely call is kayaking, it more like lazy river down a peaceful stream - so relaxing. Our guide, Jesse, was so awesome. He was SO friendly and easy to talk to, and so willing to customize our trip how ever we wanted! He even took us to places that were not on the \"list\" of regular places because we liked a certain type of wine. If we wanted to ride, we would ride, if we wanted a break, he would drive us in the van. If we changed our minds, he would unload the bikes again without hesitation. He was awesome. Jesse stayed with us about three hours past when the tour was supposed to be over since we were having so much fun. Also, the picnic in the middle of the tour was so delicious. So much food, so much good food. The winery brought wine out to us to taste while we ate. Gorgeous wine country! This is the best way to capture it and learn about wine. Highly recommended!

We decided to go kayaking on the Russian River. We had a fantastic time! We had a great guide, Michael, who was laid-back and a lot of fun. Because the river was very calm the day we kayaked, Michael was able to take us up and down the river to show us interesting birds without worrying about harsh winds or currents. He also gave us a lot of great information about the surrounding area.\n\nLunch was waiting for us at a picnic table. Michael had brought some sandwiches, vegetables and dip, potato salad, fruit, chips, and sodas. But before we ate, Michael took us down a path to nearby Goat Rock State Beach, where the last scene of Goonies was filmed!\n\nThe highlight of the trip was after lunch, when we kayaked towards the meeting point of the river and the Pacific. A colony of seals was camped out on the nearby rocks! Michael guided us a short distance away to avoid scaring them, since they were shy. But we got a great look at them, and one or two of the more curious ones even popped their heads up in the water behind our kayaks!\n\nAll in all, we really enjoyed the kayaking and would definitely do it again the next time we are in the area.

The KitePole pulls you up and across the water on a kiteboard as you lean back in your harness, allowing you to focus on acquiring the proper body and board positioning without the stress of steering a kite. Other state of the art training techniques include an in-helmet microphone, so that we can continue to speak to you from the boat while you are in the middle of the bay learning the skills. \n\nOnce the feeling of board control is achieved, you will be prepared to take on the steering responsibilities of kite-flying. To build your kite skills, you will fly a full-size, 4-line kite. You learn to dictate the kite\u2019s movements and work with the wind. Flying a kite is not as physically demanding as people think, rather it's more about being able to anticipate the kite's reaction to wind changes and make the steering adjustments in a timely fashion. \n\nLastly, you go through a self-rescue procedure.

I was headed to Hawaii in 2 weeks and wanted to (1) see if I enjoyed kitesurfing and (2) if I did like it I wanted to get enough experience to be able to kite while I was in Maui. I basically wanted to jump in with both feet and learn as quickly as possible. John was the man for the job.\n\nJohn is ideal for getting the most out of your first lessons. We were out in the bay during lesson one learning about the board skills, kiting skills and body dragging.

On the first day, you are introduced to the board skills and kite skills. On the 2nd day, you will put it all together! \n\nLearning how to kiteboard requires kite-flying skills and board skills. You must be able to do both at the same time and it is advantageous to learn each skill independently at first. We have developed an exclusive teaching technique that builds skills and confidence in a timely manner. \n\nWe teach our classes from a beautiful 21-foot Yamaha jetboat, and we are the only school in the greater San Francisco area that features the \"KitePole,\" a custom designed boom that mimics the pull of a kite. The KitePole pulls you up and across the water on a kiteboard as you lean back in your harness, allowing you to focus on acquiring the proper body and board positioning without the stress of steering the kite. Other state of the art training techniques include an in-helmet microphone, so that we can continue to speak to you from the boat while you are in the middle of the bay learning the skills. \n\nOnce the feeling of board control is achieved, you will be prepared to take on the steering responsibilities of kite-flying. To build your kite skills, you will fly a full-size, 4-line kite. You learn to dictate the kite\u2019s movements and work with the wind. Flying a kite is not physically demanding as people think, rather it's more about being able to anticipate the kite's reaction to wind changes and make the steering adjustments in a timely fashion. \n\nOn day two, we will put these skills together and get you kiteboarding! You will learn waterstarts, body-dragging, board retrieval, and discover what it takes to become to self-sufficient.

John's detailed instruction and feedback made it easy to get up and surfing and feeling like a pro! \n\nIn the second half of the lesson we got used to the kite by controlling it from the boat. Since the kite was connected to the boat, we didn't have to worry about being yanked overboard if we made a mistake. This is cool because you can focus on learning how the kite behaves without the apprehension of what it might do to you if you mess up.\n\nI can see this being the fast track to kite surfing glory since you can focus on each element of the sport separately until skilled enough in both to put them together.

This technique seems to work for me.\nThere were a couple of points where I could see the waves rising high above our ship, The Salty Lady.  I could feel the boat going straight up.\nThen blam!  The boat went down with a big whoosh!  But I didn't feel even a twinge of nausea!\n\nThe trip was 3 hours long.  We saw a cute little sea otter just nonchalantly riding the waves on his\/her back.\n\nThere was also a sighting of a porpoise which I didn't see,\n\nThen during the last hour of our trip......we saw some whales!  \nNone of the fancy jumps or other awesome manuevers.  We saw spouts and then some backs surfacing though the waves.  Still very cool.\nI took at least 7-8 photos on my digital camera but when I viewed them later there were mostly shots of the sky or empty sea......oh well,.......\nbut we really did see them!\n\nThis is at least our second or third trip with them over the years.  Once several years ago we went on a trip where we saw a RIGHT WHALE--which is on of the rarest whales in existence.  This whale came to the boat and hung around for at least an hour rolling and rolling and flirting.  Most of the people on board the boat couldn't take it's photo since they only brought these fancy expensive cameras with these long telephoto lenses.  I was able to take several photos with my cheapo insta-matic camera (before the era of digital cameras).  Apparently we were the only boat that was lucky enough to see this Right Whale.  Other whale watching excursions that day didn't see him\/her.   It was a historic trip that made the news and history.  One has not been spotted since.\n\nbtw The Right Whale is called this because it was an easy whale to hunt since  it was so docile.\n\nI think we'll try their all day long trip to the Farallons some day.","seller":true,"id":"4fb17d04536e862769000007"}],"seller":{"id":"4f9b24aa536e86f90a00001d"},"status":1,"updated":"2012-11-07T01:46:28+00:00","visible":true,"id":"4fb17961536e86d777000004"},{"category":"Marine Wildlife","complete":true,"currency":"USD","desc":"The Farallon Islands National Wildlife Refuge is the largest seabird rookery in the eastern Pacific south of Alaska, with more than 300,000 birds.

She usually has great sea legs, but got a bit tipsy last night and was hurting for the beginning of the ride. It took about 2 hours to get to the Farallon Islands and along the way we saw tons of Sea Lions, Seals birds galore and a few Harbor porpoise (they were really close to the bay...get the name?)\n\nOnce we got to the Island we killed the engine and enjoyed the view, and all of a sudden my Husband shouts \"Oh my God Shark\" There was a Great White who showed its teeth and quickly left.

And I know it is not good luck Aunt B, you will never convince me of that.\n\nWe cruised around the Islands a bit then went to the edge of the Continental shelf, you know where the ocean drops off about 2700 feet? This is where the fun begins, we started to smell this smell. Like ammonia, fish, and something nasty. That is what a whale smells like, gross. Then one surfaced and we forgot all about the smell.\n\nBlows began to show and we all shouted and pointed like kids in a Zoo. They were everywhere around us, about 12 in all feeding like mad. You could see all sorts of dolphins, they rode with the front of our boat and were a joy to watch. The Whales were majestic, flipping their tales up and eating tons and tons of fish. People were in complete awe and laughed when they came up. I have never felt so amazed at nature in my life.\n\nWe stayed there for an hour or more watching the whales, the fish under the boat (clear water!), the dolphins and everything. It was such a wonderful day. We turned back when the whales seemed to be done eating, they breached a few times and it was again amazing.

The goal was to see whales. Alas, they weren't around the Farallones that day- we did however see a glimpse of Great White Sharks, many types of seals, sea lions and birds including migrating birds of prey. Their docent was knowledgeable and interesting and there was also a rep from a Sea Turtle preservation group on board. The Salty Lady is a nice boat but most of the seating is outside so it can be very cold and damp. The trip is long (8-9 hours) and even though it was nice weather, the swells were still big and many people were sea sick the entire day. The crew was very kind but they can't do much to help- don't go on this excursion if you know you are prone to sea sickness! And if you don't know, I would test out whether you are not on another trip- this is a fairly small boat and a long day to find out. The highlight of the trip (in my opinion) is coming back into the bay under the Golden Gate Bridge and seeing the city from a very unique view. I would definitely go out with this group again.

It was a day that my wife and I agreed that we would never forget. Captain Tom brought 15 of us out during a weekday trip. The weather was hot and 90 degrees which isn't typical for SF. We spent 15 minutes watching an orca, saw a sea lion tearing apart a salmon, a few blue whales from a distance, and many humpback whales. At one point we had 3 humpback whales circling the boat near the surface for 20 minutes. The whales finally left us and about 15 min later we ran into another group of 2 humpbacks with the same results. The whales came right up next to the boat to put on a good show for us. We took some amazing pictures and video. Captain Tom and crew were very friendly and knowledgeable. I recommend the trip to all!

We followed the sound advice of the captain regarding sea-sickness along with taking dramamine since we knew we would experience rough seas. It paid off for us and we did not get sick or cold with hats, gloves, and rain gear on. Others on board didn't follow instructions and weren't as fortunate as us. The staff was very good with those that did get sick and continuously monitored those individuals.

Curious? Perhaps you\u2019ve climbed a few times in a gym and want to try the real thing? Discover what outdoor rock climbing is all about in this 4-hour clinic designed for the beginning rock climber. No climbing experience is necessary. In our level 1 class, getting you up your first few rock climbs is the goal. Additionally, we\u2019ll share the sense of adventure that drives our guides\u2019 passion for the sport, and provide you with the most enjoyable first day of climbing possible. We\u2019ll begin with a short introduction to climbing gear and safety that includes teaching basic commands and climber tie-in knots. Then we\u2019ll spend the remainder of our time climbing!\n\nRock Climbing II\nThe second part of our introduction to climbing series is for many people. If you\u2019ve taken our first class or are already familiar with basic climbing safety (figure eight knot, harness set up, and climbing on top rope), this is a great next step. This 4-hour clinic starts with a quick review of these skills. Then we\u2019ll teach you how to belay in a traditional ground school. Perhaps you\u2019ve belayed a bit in a climbing gym, but only with a grigri? This is a great starting point to round out your knowledge of belaying techniques and skills, so that you may better understand the dynamics at work in a belay system.\n\nNext, we\u2019ll start you out on some easy climbing terrain so you can comfortably belay for the first time on real rock. While on these climbs, we\u2019ll also introduce you to some fundamental climbing techniques. As time allows, we\u2019ll progress to some slightly harder terrain where we\u2019ll give you some exposure to intermediate climbing techniques while you continue to practice strong safety skills.\n\nThe combination of Introduction to Climbing 1 & Climbing 2 is the ultimate introduction to outdoor rock climbing. Depending on your previous experience and your level of interest in pursuing climbing as a new hobby, you may consider taking both classes on the same day. Alternatively, take Climbing 1 to try it out, and return soon if you\u2019ve gotten hooked on climbing. Or, for the novice to \u201cadvanced beginner\u201d gym climber with little or no belaying experience, jump straight to Climbing 2.","duration":240,"excerpt":"Introduction to Outdoor Climbing at Beautiful Castle Rock State Park!","geo":{"lat":37.230799186391,"lng":-122.09567107116},"included":["All necessary equipment"],"medias":[{"seq":3,"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4fe10461536e865313000014\/4fe24fab536e86a80800002f.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4fe24fab536e86a80800002f"},{"seq":4,"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4fe10461536e865313000014\/4fe24fac536e863749000028.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4fe24fac536e863749000028"},{"seq":5,"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4fe10461536e865313000014\/4fe24fbb536e867c74000021.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4fe24fbb536e867c74000021"},{"seq":2,"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4fe10461536e865313000014\/4fe24fd8536e86320b000021.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4fe24fd8536e86320b000021"},{"seq":1,"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4fe10461536e865313000014\/4fe24fd9536e86443500001c.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4fe24fd9536e86443500001c"},{"seq":0,"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4fe10461536e865313000014\/4fe2500a536e86320b000023.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4fe2500a536e86320b000023"}],"name":"Rock Climbing I & II Courses at Castle Rock","notIncluded":["Appropriate clothing for the outdoors","Stable footwear","Lunch\/snack","Water","Daypack","Exact packing list available upon registration"],"other":"-Supportive, Expert, Certified Guides\n-Fully Insured and Permitted School - Don't Settle For Less!\n-We teach Men, Women, and Kids - All Ages.\n\nClinics are held at Castle Rock State Park in Los Gatos, CA.

Like Yosemite Valley, the High Sierra has lured many a photographer, captivating them, and inspiring a greater enlightenment. On this tour, we will visit a select number of locations that will encapsulate the greater High Sierra. We will begin at Olmsted Point, a favorite site of many photographers from Edward Weston and Ansel Adams to contemporary professionals. From there, we will travel to Tenaya Lake to explore its granite shores, erratic boulders, stunted trees and majestic reflections. Afterwards, the tour will continue on to Tuolumne Meadows, where several different stops will yield views of the meadows, Mt. Dana, the Cathedral Range, the Tuolumne River, Lembert Dome, as well as many more landmarks. If conditions permit, evening alpenglow will blanket the Sierra crest and provide us with a vibrant, luminous scene even after the sun has dropped below the horizon.

On 2 and 3-day trips, the first day is usually a \u2018warm-up\u2019 run on the lower section of the Cal. Salmon, with plenty of Class 4 and 4+ action at Butler Creek Ledge, Double Hole and the Gaping Maw. Often this run is extended to include the Ikes on the Klamath River, which can be huge during spring run-off. Big Ike is likened to Crystal rapid in the Grand Canyon and can be a powerful Class 5 rapid at flows above 12,000 c.f.\u2019s. The more difficult run on the Cal. Salmon starts soon after the put-in at Nordheimer with four class 4 and 4+ drops in less than 2 miles. After a brief break, you then have to negotiate the tough passages of Cascade, Achilles Heel, Whirling Dervish, Last Chance and Freight Train.\n\nThe Scott River can be run as a 3rd day in combination with the Cal. Salmon, or for suitably qualified paddlers as a 2 day Class 5 trip with the upper section of the Cal. Salmon. As the Scott River is located on the drier east slopes of the Salmon-Trinity Alps, it has a shorter season than the neighboring Cal. Salmon. This trip involves a drive between the two rivers of approx. 1 \u00bc hrs to tackle the Scott on the 2nd day, ending up near Scott Bar on Hwy 96. Rapids are almost continuous, with sharp, boulder-choked drops and include Boulder Creek Falls, Canyon Creek, White House, Tompkins Creek and Schuler Gulch.\n\nThere are plenty of unique rapids on both these rivers, and the superb beauty and grace is accentuated by the rugged carved granite, the deep woods of the Klamath National Forest, and the incredible waterfalls that tumble into the canyons. The magnificent California Salmon and Scott rivers are natural wild and scenic river tributaries of the mighty Klamath River, which tumble swiftly out of the Marble Mountains and the Salmon-Trinity Alps Wilderness areas. Wildlife is plentiful, but easily hidden in this rugged terrain, although geese and eagles are often seen.\n\nCharter transportation may be available from the Sacramento area, or airport pick-up can be arranged from Redding.","duration":2880,"excerpt":"The California Salmon and Scott Rivers are two of California\u2019s top spring rivers providing Class 4 and 5 rafting thrills.

Department Of Fish and Game fisheries inspector, Kirk Lombard, (aka: \"Captain Kirk). Our two hour mission, to seek out fascinating life forms, to explore the intertidal region, to boldly go where only fishermen and biologists have gone before!\n\nThe class\/tour meets in select locations around the Bay Area, (San Francisco, Pillar Point, Pacifica to name a few, East Bay locations: Emeryville Pier, Alameda Rock Wall, etc) and explores the what, why, when and where of marine fauna.  Focusing on observation and discovery we search for intertidal organisms, find them, and then observe and discuss their behavior (or lack thereof).\n\nWhat is a limpet? How many shells does it have? Based on our observations, where do limpets appear to live? What adaptations have they evolved in order to survive in such extreme conditions? These are the types of questions I encourage the students to ask--and answer! \n\nI will cater the class to meet the specific needs of each group.  For classes that require a structured lay out, I will provide a question and answer sheet (available upon request).  For classes that prefer a less formalized approach, I have a number of different options.\n\nMy favorite is the \u201cmake your own field guide\u201d format.  In this class the children check out some cool field guides from my collection, then they draw pictures of the creatures they encounter,  give them pseudo-scientific names,  create their own made up taxonomies, and observe them, in order to write detailed entries in their self made \u201cfield guides.\u201d  Then, at the end of the class, I identify each creature and we all see how close the kids got to reality.\n\nAnother option for Captain Kirk's Coastal Odyssey, is \"the young naturalist\" class, in which the children focus on what inspires them about the intertidal region.  After an in-depth examination of tide pools, we let the kids draw and compose stories or poems about what they think it would be like to be a black tegula, or a tunicate, or a shore crab, or a monkeyface eel.\n\nAs part of the process of discovery and exploration I will have several types of fishing gear available--for all the different classes.  For those kids who are interested, I will teach the basics of how to catch crabs and fish -- and hopefully catch a few for closer observation.  We will also go over the theory behind fish and game laws, a brief discussion of local fisheries, and a basic and exciting examination of rock crab behavior and anatomy (look out for those claws, ouch!) \n\nI was recently contacted by a group of parents who wanted the class to be mostly about fishing. So we went over the basics. Knot tying, rules and regs, seasons etc, and then we spent the rest of the day checking out jack smelt, baby eels, sardines, rock crabs and toadfish!\n\nAgain, I have no problem catering the class to meet the needs\/requests of the parents and teachers. You want mostly coastal ecology? I can do that. You want an art component? No problem. You want to focus on the basics of fishing? That's fine too.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you on the water! \n\nKirk-out.","duration":120,"excerpt":"Get fishy...with intertidal guru and former CA.

The channel is protected by the island of Alameda, and warmed by both land-masses, keeping air moving for fun sailing year round.\n\tIf not side tracked by the sites and good sailing winds, continue along the 5th busiest port in the United States.

The US Coast Guard base and new Oakland Bay bridge will be in full view. The sail back to base is usually a reach or run. For those new to sailing, that means the winds will feel lighter, sun warmer and the boat will not lean much.\n\tAfter docking the boat, go around the corner to the Irish Monkey for an hour of wine tasting as part of this fun half day.

Palo Alto, CA","email":"","review":"There's no experience in the world quite like whitewater rafting.  It combines the thrill of roller coasters with the best elements of camping, backpacking, and hiking in the Great Outdoors, except with five times the fun and none of the hard work.\n\nI went rafting for the first time way back in the Eighties on the South Fork of the American River.  I rafted that river a couple of times, then got hungry for other whitewater experiences and sought them out.  A few years ago, I took my first trip on the Tuolumne River, and got totally hooked.  \n\nThe South Fork is a great \"Starter River\".  I ran across a picture of one of my Yelp friends' trips there a few weeks ago.  While the picture brought back many great memories of my first whitewater experience, the South Fork simply doesn't measure up to the Tuolumne, which I think is the best and most pristine river for whitewater rafting in the country.  The Tuolumne River is to the South Fork of the American River what a self-guided, supersonic, Patriot Missile is to a sack of rocks chucked in the general direction of an in-coming target, or what Usain Bolt sprinting at top speed with the wind at his back is to an 84 year-old Grandmother running uphill on crutches - there's simply no comparison.\n\nThe rapids on the Tuolumne vary with the month and the amount of rainfall that year.  It's dam controlled (like the most popular stretch of the South Fork), which makes river water levels more predictable during the summer season, and stretches that season out until September. However, early-season snow melt pushes the river to very high levels that are best experienced by veteran rafters. At these flows, the Tuolumne becomes one of county's most powerful whitewater runs.\n\nThe first time I went rafting on the Tuolumne, I was totally impressed with its deep canyon, pristine side streams, and crystal-clear water.  In addition to some of the most amazing Class III to Class V rapids that can be found anywhere, it has cooling swimming holes and waterfalls found in beautiful tributary streams, relaxing campgrounds with secluded beaches, and some impressively intricate wilderness areas to explore.  Only two small 20-person commercial trips are allowed in the canyon per day, and you can go your entire trip without seeing a raft that isn't from the company you're traveling with.  There are no roads to any of the camp sites, so on a two day trip, all the camping gear & food is packed in on rafts.  \n\nOn the other hand, the first whitewater company I went with to the Tuolumne left me resolved to find a better outfit to do business with in the future.  On my second trip, I went with you guys, and was totally happy with every aspect of the whitewater experience that they provided.  Their expert guides are totally knowledgeable of the river and what it takes to maximize the fun and excitement while minimizing risk.  Even better though, is the incredible camping experience they provide after the you've rafted the last rapid on the first day of a two day trip.  The guides do almost all the work (especially the cooking), leaving you free to relax under the stars, and enjoy the abundant beverages (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and world-class food, which tastes even better given the near-perfect wilderness surroundings.\n\nI've now been on three trips with Marty and his team of well-trained, experienced guides, and am planning to go again next summer.  I recommend them completely, without reservation, to anyone interested in enjoying the fabulous Tuolumne River whitewater experience.","seller":true,"id":"4f47f297536e86c416000008"},{"name":"Paolo D. Las Vegas, NV","email":"","review":"How does one follow up Half Dome, the most spectacular hike of my life? Try whitewater river rafting, which turned out to be one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life. Talk about an incredible two days!\n\nIt was also an incredibly athletic two days. I had no idea what whitewater rafting entailed. I figured you just sat in a boat and went along for the ride. I couldn't be more wrong. Your guide certainly provides some propulsion and steers the boat, but we as a team did most of the paddling.\n\nFrom start to finish, the entire outing was just tremendous. They provide everything you need - a wet suit and jacket to keep you warm, a helmet and life jacket to keep you safe, and a dry bag to store your things while on the water. They also provide a very satisfying lunch about half way through the journey.\n\nThe Tuolumne River was at high flow during our trip. This was most definitely a good thing. The rapids were roaring! Two of my friends did a rafting trip on the Merced River last year and they confirmed that this trip on the Tuolumne had more frequent rapids. Most of what we hit were class 4 with one class 5 (Clavey Falls). Our guide, Ally, was simply awesome. She considered us to be a pretty strong team, so she went big on many of the rapids. Let me tell you, there is nothing more fun than staring down a wall of water just before it drenches you and your crew.\n\nI even fell out of the boat during one the last runs. I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I suddenly found myself falling backwards off the side of the boat. All day long, I was a little scared of the prospect of going for a swim, but I'd have to say that it was the best thing that could have happened to me. Once I hit that water, the adrenaline just kicked in. Somehow, I managed to hold on to my paddle, swim back to the boat against the current, and get back in with the aid of my team. Most of the guides call that particular rapids, \"Driftwood.\" How many people get to say that they were driftwood in a class 4 rapid?\n\nAll things considered, I can't imagine how this rafting trip could have been better. You cannot go wrong with Marty and crew. Highly recommended.","seller":true,"id":"4f47f2e4536e86c616000005"},{"name":"Ken H.

So make sure you do your research about the rapids you choose to run first or you will only get a 50% refund should they deem you incapable and at $300\/person for a one day run, that can hurt.","seller":true,"id":"4f47f394536e86c716000005"}],"schedules":[{"dates":["2013-03-15","2013-03-22","2013-03-27","2013-03-29","2013-03-30","2013-03-31","2013-04-01","2013-04-02","2013-04-04","2013-04-09","2013-04-11","2013-04-15","2013-04-17","2013-04-20","2013-04-21","2013-04-27","2013-04-30","2013-05-06","2013-05-12","2013-05-15","2013-05-17","2013-05-18","2013-05-20","2013-05-21","2013-05-23","2013-05-26","2013-05-28","2013-05-31","2013-06-02","2013-06-03","2013-06-06","2013-06-07","2013-06-09","2013-06-10","2013-06-11","2013-06-13","2013-06-14","2013-06-17","2013-06-19","2013-06-23","2013-06-24","2013-06-26","2013-06-30","2013-07-02","2013-07-08","2013-07-10","2013-07-15","2013-07-18","2013-07-21","2013-07-23","2013-07-24","2013-07-29","2013-07-31","2013-08-04","2013-08-11"],"departure":"fixed","priceDelta":0,"repeat":"custom","times":[830],"id":"50a2a4f4986ae5d10300004d"}],"seller":{"id":"4f3dc4f8536e86cb11000004"},"status":1,"updated":"2013-06-06T05:12:43+00:00","visible":true,"id":"4f3edaba536e86da30000004"},{"category":"River Rafting","complete":true,"currency":"USD","deletedAt":"2013-05-15T09:50:18+00:00","desc":"This class will start at square one in a noncompetitive small group environment.

It combines the thrill of roller coasters with the best elements of camping, backpacking, and hiking in the great outdoors, except with five times the fun and none of the hard work.\n\nI went rafting for the first time way back in the Eighties on the South Fork of the American River.  I rafted that river a couple of times, then got hungry for other whitewater experiences and sought them out.  A few years ago, I took my first trip on the Tuolumne River, and got totally hooked.  \n\nThe South Fork is a great \"Starter River\".  I ran across a picture of one of my Yelp friends' trips there a few weeks ago.  While the picture brought back many great memories of my first whitewater experience, the South Fork simply doesn't measure up to the Tuolumne, which I think is the best and most pristine river for whitewater rafting in the country.  The Tuolumne River is to the South Fork of the American River what a self-guided, supersonic, Patriot Missile is to a sack of rocks chucked in the general direction of an in-coming target, or what Usain Bolt sprinting at top speed with the wind at his back is to an 84 year-old Grandmother running uphill on crutches - there's simply no comparison.\n\nThe rapids on the Tuolumne vary with the month and the amount of rainfall that year.  It's dam controlled (like the most popular stretch of the South Fork), which makes river water levels more predictable during the summer season, and stretches that season out until September. However, early-season snow melt pushes the river to very high levels that are best experienced by veteran rafters. At these flows, the Tuolumne becomes one of county's most powerful whitewater runs.\n\nThe first time I went rafting on the Tuolumne, I was totally impressed with its deep canyon, pristine side streams, and crystal-clear water.  In addition to some of the most amazing Class III to Class V rapids that can be found anywhere, it has cooling swimming holes and waterfalls found in beautiful tributary streams, relaxing campgrounds with secluded beaches, and some impressively intricate wilderness areas to explore.  Only two small 20-person commercial trips are allowed in the canyon per day, and you can go your entire trip without seeing a raft that isn't from the company you're traveling with.  There are no roads to any of the camp sites, so on a two day trip, all the camping gear & food is packed in on rafts.  \n\nOn the other hand, the first whitewater company I went with to the Tuolumne left me resolved to find a better outfit to do business with in the future.  On my second trip, I went with these guys, and was totally happy with every aspect of the whitewater experience that they provided.  Their expert guides are totally knowledgeable of the river and what it takes to maximize the fun and excitement while minimizing risk.  Even better though, is the incredible camping experience they provide after the you've rafted the last rapid on the first day of a two day trip.  The guides do almost all the work (especially the cooking), leaving you free to relax under the stars, and enjoy the abundant beverages (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and world-class food, which tastes even better given the near-perfect wilderness surroundings.\n\nI've now been on three trips with Marty and his team of well-trained, experienced guides, and am planning to go again next summer.

Try whitewater river rafting, which turned out to be one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life. Talk about an incredible two days!\n\nIt was also an incredibly athletic two days. I had no idea what whitewater rafting entailed. I figured you just sat in a boat and went along for the ride. I couldn't be more wrong. Your guide certainly provides some propulsion and steers the boat, but we as a team did most of the paddling.\n\nFrom start to finish, the entire outing was just tremendous. Our guides provided everything you need - a wet suit and jacket to keep you warm, a helmet and life jacket to keep you safe, and a dry bag to store your things while on the water. They also provide a very satisfying lunch about half way through the journey.\n\nThe Tuolumne River was at high flow during our trip. This was most definitely a good thing. The rapids were roaring! Two of my friends did a rafting trip on the Merced River last year and they confirmed that this trip on the Tuolumne had more frequent rapids. Most of what we hit were class 4 with one class 5 (Clavey Falls). Our guide, Ally, was simply awesome. She considered us to be a pretty strong team, so she went big on many of the rapids. Let me tell you, there is nothing more fun than staring down a wall of water just before it drenches you and your crew.\n\nI even fell out of the boat during one the last runs. I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I suddenly found myself falling backwards off the side of the boat. All day long, I was a little scared of the prospect of going for a swim, but I'd have to say that it was the best thing that could have happened to me. Once I hit that water, the adrenaline just kicked in. Somehow, I managed to hold on to my paddle, swim back to the boat against the current, and get back in with the aid of my team. Most of the guides call that particular rapids, \"Driftwood.\" How many people get to say that they were driftwood in a class 4 rapid?\n\nAll things considered, I can't imagine how this rafting trip could have been better.

All day long, I was a little scared of the prospect of going for a swim, but I'd have to say that it was the best thing that could have happened to me. Once I hit that water, the adrenaline just kicked in. Somehow, I managed to hold on to my paddle, swim back to the boat against the current, and get back in with the aid of my team. Most of the guides call that particular rapids, \"Driftwood.\" How many people get to say that they were driftwood in a class 4 rapid?\n\nAll things considered, I can't imagine how this rafting trip could have been better. You cannot go wrong with this company. Highly recommended.","seller":true,"id":"4f7f89c0536e86951d00000d"},{"name":"Mellissa B. Emeryville, CA","email":"","review":"These guys rocked my socks! I used them to raft Cherry Creek's class V rapids and i am so very glad i chose this company! All of their guides are highly experienced, professional and very friendly. The food they provide is superb and they even give you a champagne toast at the end of your run! A few things to keep in mind though, they will give you a physical fitness and swim  test and are not shy about telling you that you are not capable of making the run. So make sure you do your research about the rapids you choose to run first or you will only get a  50% refund should they deem you incapable and at $300\/person for a one day run, that can hurt.","seller":true,"id":"4f7f89eb536e86a21d00000f"},{"name":"Ken H.

Each one had his own take on photography and really helped in my pictures. The workshops I have taken in the past really don't even compare. They were geared around the instructors getting great images and not the students. Sure, they take you to great spots, but that's it..They don't even measure up to the photographers that you have on staff. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were more concerned with the training the students than themselves.\n\nNina and I really enjoyed our session with Phil. The methods he showed us on taking abstract photographs were really new thing for me, but I have some really unique and fascinated images for my wall. After spending time with Walter Flint(two days), I really slowed down. I didn't take as many images, but they\u2019re great! Our last workshop with Robb Hirsch was even better. Robb was so helpful in every way possible. He helped me in creating some amazing images that I didn't expect from myself. I learned just as much from him as the other instructors, but in a different way. He spent time teaching me more about composition than I even imagined. And, I am really proud of myself and the images I created!\n \nOnce again, thank you for all your help!","seller":true,"id":"4f281a67536e860e20000001"},{"name":"Fred Crowden","email":"fred_crowden@yahoo.com","review":"I enjoyed my workshop today and I learned a lot.

The care you showed in making sure your photographer addressed my needs, far in advance of actually getting to Yosemite were impressive.  After your detailed guidance on driving to Yosemite, where to get chains for my car rental and then where to meet your photographer, my experience was only out done by the GREAT photography instruction provided by Robb Hirsch, your staff photography instructor.  Robb not only gave great instructions on composition and various photographic techniques, he made suggestions for inexpensive additions to add to my equipment to dramatically improve my photographs.  We've got some great photographs from our vacation that we wouldn't have had without Robb's instruction!

Typical Strenuous Hikes would include trails to Waterwheel Falls, El Capitan, Clouds Rest, & Half Dome summit attempts.\n\nSummiting Half Dome in Yosemite is a major accomplishment, and our experienced Yosemite guides provide you with interpretation, preparation, trail knowledge, coaching, safety gear, and the benefit of added security for anyone attempting this remarkable feat. We prepare you for the long one-day journey (2 days as a backpack trip), provide insight to the trail, offer assistance on the cables, and help you maintain your confidence throughout the day so you are able to focus on achieving your goal. Join us for a Strenuous Half Dome hiking tour and reward yourself with breathtaking views and a true sense of fulfillment.\n\nPanoramic views are as incomparable as the sense of achievement you will feel upon completion of this epic adventure. Achieve the summit and you will earn your very own Half Dome Summit Club Patch.\n\nOur lead guide John DeGrazio has directed over 100 successful summits of Half Dome since YExplore was founded in 2006. With that experience, he has developed and shared several techniques with our clients on the Half Dome hike. Our high success rate is a direct result of the advantages provided by these strategies.\n\nOur educational tour will explore the geologic and natural history of Half Dome, Yosemite, and the Sierra Nevada combined with a photography workshop teaching all students the art of making nature photographs. Equipped with our cameras, we will make the epic all day journey. Our instructors will teach about the aspects of exposure throughout several different periods of changing light that will make each photograph unique and interesting. This exciting all inclusive adventure will not only take you to the top, but you will end your day with a broader knowledge of the ecology and a sense of achievement both physically and photographically that you never imagined.","duration":1440,"excerpt":"Embark on a journey of self discovery during this life altering experience on Half Dome, Yosemite's most iconic peak.

Trails weave through a wonderland of standing desert rocks with far-reaching vistas. We\u2019ll also visit many famous arches, including Landscape Arch, the longest in the world.\n\nDay three we transfer locations from Moab to Bluff, stopping along the way to enjoy a spectacular hike in canyons at Natural Bridges National Monument. The town of Bluff still has an original pioneer fort dating back to 1880 when the first settlers arrived. Our home here is the Desert Rose Inn with its massive timbers and western charm. Hikes nearby lead to remote pictographs,petroglyphs and ruins from the time of the Ancestral Puebloan Indians.\n\nOur final day takes us back to Arches where we enjoy a short hike to the iconic Delicate Arch.

Depending on the tour's itinerary, we may meander among giant sequoias, some of the largest trees in the world and learn about their unique life history and ecological roles. Each year, wildflowers blanket the Sierra Nevada. Yosemite is the home to several unique species that can be found throughout spring and summer. With dynamic shifts in elevation, Yosemite is the perfect place to watch the progression of the flowers as they move from the foothills to the high country.\n\nWhether you are someone who just loves looking at birds or an expert looking to track down specialty birds of the western mountains, we can create a custom birding package to match your needs where you may find some of Yosemite's many birds with a naturalist on this tour through some of the park's most productive habitats. Join us on a one-day \u201cnaturalist\u2019s transect\u201d that will introduce you to the full range of ecological zones in the park.

The birding in the wetlands is just phenomenal. The Giacomini Ranch was established over 50 years ago at the head of Tomales Bay near downtown Point Reyes Station.  In order to create pastureland from existing salt marsh, Rancher Waldo Giacomini built levees and tide gates to manage tidal incursion.  The levees significantly altered the patterns of estuarine circulation and sediment deposition in the area. In 2000 the Point Reyes National Seashore purchased 563 acres of the Giacomini farmland in order to begin the long, delicate process of restoring the wetlands.  The project took eight and a half years to finish. The levees have now been removed, adding approximately 4% to existing California salt marshes. The Giacomini Wetlands can be viewed from strategically placed, yet somewhat limited trails and viewing areas, or (even better) from a kayak at high tide, gliding through areas where the human foot is now forbidden but non-motorized boats are not.","duration":240,"excerpt":"The Nature Hike will meet at the Coastal Access Trail about 1 mile north of Pt.

Our weekly programs are six days\/ five nights in length and average between 30-35 backpacking miles. These trips usually begin in the Yosemite High Country and conclude in Yosemite Valley proper. On all trips we conduct some side hikes (without backpacks) to famous sites and peaks (such as Half Dome, Clouds Rest, El Capitan, Mount Hoffman, and Red Peak). These day trips average another 6 to 12 miles.\n\nEvery other week we offer a different trail. So if you would like to choose a two-week adventure (13 days\/ 12 nights) by combining two sessions; your child will be guaranteed to see different terrain each week. Additionally, by choosing the two-week option, your child will have a layover day in either Tuolumne Meadows or Yosemite Valley proper where the participants will partake in more sightseeing opportunities. During this layover day, participants will also have a chance to re-supply, wash-up, and eat some \u201cgood\u201d food at a local eatery.\n\nThroughout the adventure, participants will be guided along some of the most famous trails and to the top of some of the most famous passes and peaks within Yosemite National Park. Yet, viewing the Yosemite backcountry is only one of the many outcomes that occur on these trips. Our primary mission is to use the natural environment and outdoor activities to teach participants the necessary skills and attitudes for living successful lives.\n\nOur experienced leaders have an extensive knowledge of the Yosemite backcountry. In addition to taking our participants to many of the famous locations, our leaders will also guide participants to lesser known areas that we have found over the years such as off-the-trail high alpine lakes (where fish are plentiful), backcountry waterfalls, alpine meadows, watering holes, cliff jumping areas, and natural waterslides. On most trips, we backpack every day but one (a lay over day and location is usually agreed upon by the team) and we are on the trail for an average of 4-5 hours. Most of our trips go from a higher elevation to a lower elevation and throughout the experience we take our time, take in the views, and break at awesome watering holes.","duration":18720,"excerpt":"Double the adventure and double the fun.

Start training by walking 30-45 consecutive minutes. Build sessions until you can walk about two to three  hours at a good pace. If your jogger, progress to running 2-3 miles at a moderate pace (10-11 minute miles). Go further if you can. Taper down conditioning during and through the week before the trip.\u201d\n\t\nTaken from, \u201cOne Best Hike: Yosemite\u2019s Half Dome,\u201d by Rick Deutsch, Wilderness press, 2007.\n\nParticipants on the Extended Adventure will get a layover day in the middle of the trip to shower, clean-up, and switch out with some clean clothes that can be packed in advance and left with our guides.\n\nAlthough we have a No Refund policy; we will consider cancellations on an individual basis and offer credits if at all possible.

When you're doing something so nutballs insane you want to make sure the person who's rubberband you're using didn't have the the swiss army knife fairy cutting away at the rope all night. You have to be able to trust the person you're going to dangle off the bridge with and Dan was definitely the kind of guy worth trusting hands down. He took the time to not only convince me that it would be safe with his 100% perfect safety record over the last 2 decades, his checking and double checking his equipment, the thorough explanations as I called him 3 or 4 times to make sure I wasn't going to be saying hi to God the day of the jump (or the devil, since I'd love to start working on my drunken deviant merit badge). We met around 6:00 am the day of the jump about an hour before dawn. (January 7th the weekend after New Years, so as you can imagine it was freeze your balls off cold) He explained what me and my group would have to do in getting ready for our drunken kool-aide leap to our deaths. We geared up and one by one at sunrise started leaping into the abyss of the bridge to the amusement of passersby and hoary old fishermen under the bridge laughing their collective asses off. He even let me take pictures and video of the whole experience which like a photo taking fiend I made sure to capture every moment of the experience with all my friends jumping off the bridge and having the time of their lives. If you're interested in trying to cheat death yourself then you can go to Dan's site at: http:\/\/www.icarusbunge... and if you're interested in seeing the video I took of this insane bungee adventure you can see it at my little old Youtube page: http:\/\/youtu.be\/Htf8XL... If you decide to go bungee jumping choose the man with the 100% safety record for 22 years, cheap rates, and who loves what he does and wants each person who jumps to love it as much as he does.

We will discuss the techniques of wide angle photography, macro, and telephoto to isolate and simplify a subject. All the best landscape and nature photographers produce consistently great images because they not only know the technical and aesthetic aspects of their medium, but they also know their subject. Likewise, participants will discover the elements of both Hetch Hetchy and Yosemite Valleys that make them special from their geology, to the flora and fauna, and history. You'll apply your newfound technical knowledge coupled with your personal emotion\/vision to create meaningful interpretations of both valleys. Tours last approximately 4 hours and may require up to 5 miles easy walking.\n\nMinimum Requirements: Any camera which offers manual control over the shutter speed and aperture. Digital cameras preferred because they offer instant feedback. An SLR with a pair of lenses (i.e. wide angle zoom and a long telephoto) would be ideal. We frequently encounter wildlife in these areas so a long lens is handy to have on hand. A tripod is strongly recommended. \n\nEach photography workshop we offer is a unique interpretive educational experience. Our Photo Guides have lived and worked in Yosemite for many years and will help you discover some of the park's lesser known shooting locations. Participants may choose their subjects and specific topics, and our professional photographer will plan a tour especially for each student. Further, their main focus will be on improving your photography (not their own) throughout the entire session to ensure that you leave Yosemite with a new found knowledge and some of the best photos in your library. It is that personal attention that separates us from our competitors.","duration":240,"excerpt":"Each photography workshop we offer is a unique interpretive educational experience.

The skies are deep blue and can be cloudless for weeks on end. With crisp mountain air in the mornings and sunshine in the afternoons, it is truly a hiker's paradise. If you love to hike and cook, then this trip is for you. Active Gourmand Tahoe is for those that love the outdoors, but have a true passion for food and fine wines. \nThe first hike of your Tahoe adventure is scenery packed. The trail dips up and down along an undeveloped secluded portion of Lake Tahoe's shoreline providing incredible views at every turn. We hike over a babbling creek, passing brilliant displays of lupine and sugar peas among the shady pine forest. The evening\u2019s cooking class will focus on flavor structure and how to create restaurant style dishes. Understanding flavor and balance will not only lay the foundation for the following evening's class but it will be incorporated into a four course tasting menu served that night; illustrating first hand what these techniques can achieve.\n\nOn your second day after breakfast, accompany Chef Jacob to our local farmers market just down the street from the hotel. There you will learn how to look for great produce at the peak of the season. The hike for the day will begin late morning in the territory made infamous by the story of the Donner Party tragedy in 1847. Your guides will share with you the history of the area around Donner Pass, the final high pass in the pioneers\u2019 journey west of the Rockies -- a fatal final challenge for many. The evening\u2019s multi-course culinary experience will feature hand picked produce that was selected at the morning's farmers market. Chef Jacob will discuss tips and tricks on how to write a seasonal menu and enhance summer produce through proper techniques and flavor pairings.\n\nThe trip would not be complete without a hike to secluded Ellis Lake. Relax and swim at the lake or go to the summit of Ellis Peak (8,740 ft elevation), where the reward is a captivating panoramic view of Lake Tahoe, Desolation Wilderness and much more. The day will conclude with our \u201cLet\u2019s talk Wine\u201d dinner \u2013 which begins with 4 tapas that have been expertly paired with special wines. Learn why and how certain wines pair with what foods. Afterwards, enjoy dinner from the Stella menu and have it properly paired by our wine expert.\n\nOur last day\u2019s hike begins among wild roses and follows along the north bank of Sagehen Creek, passing through aspen and willow trees and ponds created by the busywork of the Mountain Beaver. The trail weaves through the forest until you reach a large meadow near Stampede Reservoir where Canadian geese can be seen raising their families and camas lilies abound in the spring.\nHighlights:\n\u2022 Panoramic Views of Lake Tahoe\n\u2022 Unspoiled trails and mountain peaks\n\u2022 The Pacific Crest Trail\n\u2022 Morning Trip to Farmer's Market\n\u2022 Hands on Cooking Classes followed by multi-course wine dinner\n","duration":5760,"excerpt":"Enjoy scenery packed day hikes that are followed by an early evening cooking class and multi-course wine dinner.","geo":{"lat":38.929502416387,"lng":-120.06408691406},"groupSize":1,"guestType":"normal","included":["Complimentary airport shuttle (scheduled time)","Complimentary transportation throughout the tour","Knowledgeable and friendly guides","All permit and park entrance fees","All meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner)","4 nights-the Cedar House Sport Hotel"],"medias":[{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4f359b33536e868b4e000006\/4f359b52536e866349000007.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4f359b52536e866349000007"},{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4f359b33536e868b4e000006\/4f359b6b536e869f52000001.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4f359b6b536e869f52000001"},{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4f359b33536e868b4e000006\/4f359b80536e869b4f000000.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4f359b80536e869b4f000000"},{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4f359b33536e868b4e000006\/4f359b92536e86ea4f000002.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4f359b92536e86ea4f000002"},{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4f359b33536e868b4e000006\/4f359baf536e86b249000005.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4f359baf536e86b249000005"},{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4f359b33536e868b4e000006\/4f359baf536e86eb4f000001.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4f359baf536e86eb4f000001"},{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4f359b33536e868b4e000006\/4f359c12536e862554000000.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4f359c12536e862554000000"},{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4f359b33536e868b4e000006\/4f359c3b536e869f52000002.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4f359c3b536e869f52000002"},{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4f359b33536e868b4e000006\/4f359c50536e862554000001.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4f359c50536e862554000001"},{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4f359b33536e868b4e000006\/4f359c62536e869b4f000001.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4f359c62536e869b4f000001"},{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4f359b33536e868b4e000006\/4f359c74536e86aa53000000.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4f359c74536e86aa53000000"},{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4f359b33536e868b4e000006\/4f359c89536e867354000000.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4f359c89536e867354000000"},{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/4f359b33536e868b4e000006\/4f39b950536e862913000000.jpg","type":"photo","id":"4f39b950536e862913000000"}],"name":"The Active Gourmand in Lake Tahoe","notIncluded":["Airfare","Alcoholic beverages","Guide tips"],"other":"Trip Dates:\nJuly 22-26, 2012\nAugust 12-16, 2012\nSeptember 2-6, 2012\n\nSingle Supplement: $330; w\/o lodging $1,299.\nCustom trips also available.\n\nCancellation Policy: In the event we must cancel a trip due to insufficient enrollment, you will receive a full refund.

In 1863 a group of trappers were camping along this creek when they were surprised by a group of indians.  The indians stole all but a couple of mules so the party had to cache their remaining supplies.  The creek took its name from this event.  This creek has a great supply of Cutthroat Trout and is ideal for a few days of fishing.\n \nOn our first day we'll ride 6 miles to the Lower Cache Creek site, where we'll set up our home away from home for the next  two nights. We'll begin fishing  as soon as we arrive in camp, as it lies right on the creek.  We'll spend day two fishing up and down Cache Creek exploring the pockets and pools which hold nice vibrant cutthroat trout.  Anyone who is not up for fishing can ride up Cache Creek for some photography as we climb alongside the Thunderer for some great alpine shots or the occasional buffalo, wolf, or bear meandering up and down the trail.  Our nights will be filled with tales around the camp fire, good food and relaxation.   Our last day we'll fish around camp while the guides pack things up and then head back toward home.\n","duration":4320,"excerpt":"Fish Yellowstone National Park's pristine waters.

Shoshone Lake is the largest backcountry lake in the contiguous United States. There is no road access and only hand-propelled boats may reach its waters. Launching on the north shore of Lewis Lake, we paddle a short distance along the shore until we reach the Lewis River Channel. This beautiful two-mile section of the Lewis River, which connects Lewis Lake to Shoshone Lake, has a gentle current over a gravel and sand bottom. The upper mile has just enough current to make it impossible to paddle against it, but it is only ankle to knee deep, so we paddle, hike and wade upstream towing our kayaks until we reach the shore of Shoshone lake. Shortly after we get to Shoshone Lake we\u2019ll make camp at a primitive campsite on the beach. The next 2 days as we make our way around the lake, we\u2019ll paddle along the rocky cliffs and gravel shores, and explore the Shoshone Geyser Basin, one of Yellowstone\u2019s most spectacular and remote geyser basins.\n\nFrom there we paddle across, or depending on the weather, around the lake, spending the night at another beautiful campsite. We spend the third day paddling across to the other end of the lake, and enjoy a short hike up to the even more remote Pocket Lake. We\u2019ll hike along side creeks through endless lodgepole forests, wildflower meadows, and abundant wildlife in their native environment. The final day we start early, since we still have to go through the channel, moving downstream this time, and paddle across Lewis Lake to get back to the boat ramp by mid-afternoon. Adding a fourth day to this trip, gives us another full day to explore and enjoy the amazing scenery and solitude of Yellowstone\u2019s vast wilderness. An unforgettable journey with a perspective few people are privileged to see, this trip into the Yellowstone backcountry wilderness is truly one of the finest paddling trips in the country.","duration":5760,"excerpt":"Join us for an unforgettable adventure exploring beautiful Wyoming!","geo":{"lat":44.350687512644,"lng":-110.76639175415},"group":{"min":2},"guestType":"normal","included":[],"medias":[{"caption":"","seq":0,"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/51752e0a3e269ebb42000027\/51752e113e269e9f4500001b.jpg","type":"photo","id":"51752e113e269e9f4500001b"}],"name":"4 Day Lewis and Shoshone Lake Tour","notIncluded":[],"other":"Please call or email with any questions and to confirm dates and availability prior to booking.","photo":{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/51752e0a3e269ebb42000027\/51752e113e269e9f4500001b.jpg","type":"photo","id":"51752e113e269e9f4500001b"},"price":995,"priceType":"person","reviewed":false,"schedules":[{"departure":"fixed","times":[900],"repeat":"custom","dates":["2013-06-26","2013-07-08","2013-07-27","2013-08-07","2013-08-21","2013-09-13"],"priceDelta":0,"id":"5194fb4c3e269e5c01000033"}],"seller":{"id":"51752a153e269ed14700000b"},"status":1,"updated":"2013-05-16T15:41:50+00:00","visible":true,"id":"51752e0a3e269ebb42000027"},{"category":"Kayaking & Canoeing","complete":true,"currency":"USD","desc":"In 1871, F.V.

Such a vision is worth a lifetime.\u201d\n\nNothing compares to the excitement generated by paddling a kayak into the coves and inlets in the pristine southern arms of Yellowstone Lake. This is one of the best inland paddling destinations in the country. Encompassing over 135 square miles, with 20-mile stretches of open water, and 110 miles of shoreline, Yellowstone Lake is the largest freshwater lake in the United States above 7,500 feet. The Southeast Arm, the largest of the lake\u2019s branches, is seven miles long and one to four miles across. This remote and secluded sound is by far the best place to view the snow-topped peaks of the Absaroka Range and experience the amazing concentration of wildlife in the looping channels of the Yellowstone River, and the broad Thoroughfare Valley through which it flows. Earning its name from early trappers and explorers, the Thoroughfare was a convenient natural passageway from Yellowstone Lake to Jackson Hole.","duration":5760,"excerpt":"Join us for an exciting adventure, and experience a part of Yellowstone few people ever see!","geo":{"lat":44.470614732621,"lng":-110.35955429078},"group":{"min":2},"guestType":"normal","included":[],"medias":[{"caption":"","seq":0,"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/51752d123e269ea24600001b\/51752d173e269e6a40000011.jpg","type":"photo","id":"51752d173e269e6a40000011"}],"name":"4 Day Yellowstone Lake Tour","notIncluded":[],"other":"Please call or email with any questions and to confirm dates and availability prior to booking.","photo":{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/51752d123e269ea24600001b\/51752d173e269e6a40000011.jpg","type":"photo","id":"51752d173e269e6a40000011"},"price":995,"priceType":"person","reviewed":false,"schedules":[{"departure":"fixed","times":[800],"repeat":"custom","dates":["2013-07-16","2013-07-30","2013-08-14","2013-08-26","2013-09-04"],"priceDelta":0,"id":"5194fdd73e269e5901000025"}],"seller":{"id":"51752a153e269ed14700000b"},"status":1,"updated":"2013-05-16T15:41:54+00:00","visible":true,"id":"51752d123e269ea24600001b"},{"category":"Kayaking & Canoeing","complete":true,"currency":"USD","desc":"This is the ultimate Yellowstone kayaking trip. Yellowstone Lake is at the centerpiece of the 20 million-acre Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region that also includes Grand Teton National Park and acreage from several other national forests, creating the world\u2019s largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone. The result is a virtual boreal Serengeti and an amazing concentration of wildlife that includes elk, moose, bison, wolves, and of course bear.\n\nWe begin on the eastern shore of Yellowstone Lake where we pack our kayaks with enough gear and supplies for six full days and five nights in the wilderness. As you guide your kayak south along the untamed shore leaving civilization behind, you begin to settle in to a relaxed pace, allowing your mind and spirit to escape from the stresses of normal life.\n\nMornings in the South and Southeast arms of Yellowstone Lake dawn brilliantly clear, cold, and flat calm. After a hot breakfast and a mug of steaming coffee, soon we are kayaking into the Yellowstone River\u2019s wide delta. There is so much wildlife in this two-mile-long shoreline, a veritable kingdom of birds. You may never feel the urge to go farther. Paddling to the river mouth, through shallow water, with thousands of ducks and geese, and even a few trumpeter swans moving around us, while ospreys, bald eagles, and cormorants (to name a few) perched on tree snags or soared overhead. Floating silently offshore in our kayaks, we\u2019ll count the moose loafing belly-deep in the weed beds or browsing the heavy willows closer to shore. Big bull elk also venture in to the lake, dipping their heads and massive racks underwater to come up with clumps of plants dangling from their mouths and pointed antlers.\n\nYour guide will paddle with you 2 \u2013 10 miles each day, to several different backcountry campsites, with 2 layover days where we can go paddling with empty kayaks and enjoy some beautiful day hikes without having to break down our tents and move camp. As we paddle towards Sedge Bay, hugging the shore through the entire South Arm and Southeast Arm of the lake, we share all our extensive knowledge of the area along the way.

Shoshone Lake, the park\u2019s second largest lake, is located entirely in the backcountry at the head of the Lewis River. The largest backcountry lake in the contiguous United States, there is no road access and only hand-propelled boats may reach its waters. The Shoshone Geyser Basin is at the farthest most point on Shoshone Lake, and to just get there takes at least 2 days. This geyser basin can only reached by hiking 17 miles, or by kayak. One of the highest concentrations of geysers in the world is found here, with more than 80 actively erupting. On the first day, we paddle across Lewis Lake, then up the Lewis River Channel. This two-mile section of the Lewis River, which connects Lewis Lake to Shoshone Lake, has a gentle current over a gravel and sand bottom. We can paddle upstream for about a mile, then we have to get out of our boats and tow our boats a short distance up the rest of the channel. Our boats will still float, but the current is just too strong to paddle against. Once we get to Shoshone Lake,  we paddle a short distance further to a primitive campsite on one of the lakes pristine beaches. The next day we continue to paddle around Shoshone Lake to the geyser basin, where we can spend several hours having lunch and walking around and exploring this incredible area. We\u2019ll paddle back to our campsite that afternoon arriving in plenty of time to relax on the beach and take in another one of Shoshone Lake\u2019s beautiful beaches, and return through the Lewis River Channel the following day.

To complement this, you will have access to photography coaching and critiques to help you reach the next level you desire in photography.\n\nYour photography guide, Niobe Burden (www.niobeburden.com), will tailor her instruction to suit every type of photographer. Whether you are a casual photo buff wanting to learn more about your point and shoot camera, or an advanced amateur with a digital SLR wanting to reach a new level of skill, this tour isn\u2019t to be missed.\n\nBoth point and shoot digital camera enthusiasts and digital SLRs are encouraged. Laptop computers are also recommended but not required to allow for possible one on one critiques and for you to download your photos and choose images for the group critiques.

After a brief introduction of equipment and paddling techniques, your guide will lead you on an easy paddle to a remote area in the Yellowstone backcountry.\n\nWe start by paddling around the shoreline of Lewis Lake to reach the river channel connecting the two lakes. Once inside the channel, we\u2019ll stop for lunch, then paddle and hike\/wade upstream towing our kayaks until we reach the shore of Shoshone lake. The channel is about 2 miles long, and the upper mile has just enough current to make it impossible to paddle against it, but it is only ankle to knee deep. Once there we paddle another half mile to our campsite, arriving in plenty of time to set up camp then relax and enjoy before dinner.On the second day, after a leisurely breakfast then breaking camp, we can paddle and float down the entire channel back to Lewis lake, have lunch then paddle back to our vehicles, arriving around 4pm.\n\nWe supply all the necessary kayaking gear and lots of excellent food.

In the morning we will pack up all of your camping gear into a boat so that we can take it down the same river you\u2019ll be rafting. Once on the water the excitement begins right away with a class III rapid we call, Good Morning! The first half of the trip takes you through rapids of all levels, highlighted by the legendary American River class V rapid, Tunnel Chute. Tunnel Chute is a 15-foot wide, 90-foot long churning chute of white water that finishes in a plunge into peaceful tunnel. All that adds up to a breathe-taking white water rafting adventure that everyone will be talking about for years.\n\nAfter navigating through Kanaka Falls and other exciting white water rapids, you will arrive at a picturesque stretch of flat water. The extended time frame for this run allows us to stop in this area for waterfall hikes at Dardenelle Creek. After stopping to hike up a beautiful riverside creek you will eat a delicious lunch along the tranquil banks of the American River. Getting back on the water after lunch, you will be able to observe the resplendent canyon, with its lush vegetation including towering pines, blackberry bushes bustling with fruit, and wild grapevines. In the afternoon we will stop along the side of the river to set up our wilderness camp. While you are setting up your tent for the evening, our multi-talented staff of experienced guides will be preparing a gourmet dinner of tri tip, chicken, salad, garlic bread, and cowboy potatoes (or customized menu if requested). The sun will start to go down over the American River canyon just in time to serve up a special River and Rock Adventures dessert tradition, all made for you right on the side of the river.\n\nDay 2: Wake up to the smell of blueberry pancakes, eggs, sausage and fresh fruit. We will pack up the gear boat after breakfast and get back on the water. The morning continues down the scenic flat water stretch until lunch. We stop to hike and have lunch at Canyon Creek and gear up to end the day with a bang. The day will finish with a jaw-dropping series of class IV white water rapids and a necessary portage around the class VI Ruck-A-Chucky Falls, where River and Rock Adventures' guides will entertain paddlers with their skill and bravery.

We provide extensive guide training to our staff. Our guides are trained on site for our specific zip line course.  All guides are CPR and First Aid certified. Due to our close proximity to Twin Falls, ID. First Responders can be on sight in less than five minutes. Our guides are also trained in line retrieval and rescue techniques specific to our zip line operation. We have quarterly training reviews which emphasize safety, policies and procedures.\n\nAs a standard procedure before zip lining, guests must participate in a short, detailed safety course. Our guests go through a live briefing on safety, how to use the gear and what to do and not to do. Guest have two rules to remember: First and foremost, \u201cThe Guides handle all the gear.\u201d And second, \u201d Have Fun\u201d. Our guests NEVER go out on the course by themselves and are always accompanied by a minimum of 2 qualified guides. Guests must meet weight and physical requirements before being allowed out on the course. All restrictionisare for everyone\u2019s safety.","discount":{"child":{"age":"12","amount":"10"}},"duration":120,"excerpt":"Zip the Snake provides an adrenaline charge zip line experience in the heart of the Magic Valley's Snake River Canyon.

From harvesting mussels, to netting night smelt, to clamming and poke poling for monkey face eels, there is something for everyone.  He also discusses sustainable local fisheries along the way.  I highly recommend his workshops.","seller":true,"id":"4f6025c7536e86511d000025"},{"name":"Laura T.","email":"","review":"I have and will never care about anything as much as this man cares about fish, including my kids probably.

If you have all this free time, why aren't you practicing math and\/or piano? At this rate, you will never get into Harvard. Go read a book.) Kirk's eccentric sense humour, wide-ranging knowledge, and manic enthusiasm is so infectious that I am actually considering obtaining a fishing licence and going mussel-picking, despite my being pretty much allergic to nature and having a corresponding aversion to the outdoors.  He made three hours standing around by the water on a grey, blustery, rainy day feel like minutes, with his stream of colourful anecdotes about sieving smelt through an A-frame net in the moonlight, giant sharks and the best way to cook limpets (which involves hammers, violence).

You aren't going to be fishing during this tour - but if you've had any interest, afterward you are going to be mentally making your shopping list. My boyfriend and I are definitely going to pick up the tools we need to try our hand at crab!\n\nThis tour makes fishing accessible to people of all levels of experience (see: reference to me crab fishing!). Being a total novice, that is something I really appreciated.\n\nKirk created a very comfortable environment where people could ask plenty of questions and he was gracious answering everything (even providing a demo in answer to a specific question after the tour had ended).\n\nIf you're going: dress warmly and in layers, boots are not a necessity (don't let that stop you from going; we didn't need ours once), and be open to whatever might happen (who can predict what you might see or catch :).\n\nThanks Kirk, can't wait to put all the tips and info to good use!

A more leisurely pace will allow the group time to examine a vast selection of subjects in beautiful light and appreciate the wildflowers and forest details framed by mountain and lake views. Niobe's individual instruction will be tailored to your needs whether you are a casual or serious photo enthusiast who desires to go to the next level.\n\nWith group instruction you will practice setting up compositions by looking to all corners of the frame and working with different types of light.

Everything that you can see, touch and smell is nothing but energy -- simply manifested in different forms: from subtle to solid. On a subatomic level you can see this dance of life. \nWe live in a magical vibrating Universe: light is vibration, sound is vibration, matter is vibration.  Every emotion has a specific vibration -- exact location in the fabric of Creation.  Using this principle you can access  even deeply buried subconscious stuff, understand and change it. Through healing process one can release a tremendous amount of energy that can be utilized for so many purposes.  What was your fear or stress yesterday can become your source of inspiration today.\nBelieve it or not the ultimate source of our suffering -- is our mind. It forms our perception of the world through specific thinking patterns.  Some of them take roots when we are very young, while some continue forming throughout our lives. They do not only define how we react on things, perceive the world around us as safe of hostile but also how others perceive us -- it is what we project into the world. Such a big part of any healing is to realize which patterns no longer serve your highest good and let them go. Any little effort leads to big results.\n\nThere are many healing methods -- Reiki, sound healing, crystals, Sat Nam Rasayan, shamanic ceremonies, etc. They are like colors of the rainbow -- all vibrant, unique and powerful.\nGenerally speaking what happens during a healing session is that the healer acts like a channel for high vibrational energy to reach you, at the same time holding sacred space for you to feel safe and protected. This way a dis-ease can be transformed into EASE. A healer is able to tune in to those destructive subconscious patterns, bring them to your awareness and help you release them.  Essentially a healer helps you make this leap from the dense low vibrations to high harmonious vibrations, where you can feel happy, balanced and full of life. Experience deep personal transformation in the nurturing environment of Sedona.","duration":60,"excerpt":"Join us for an energy healing experience that will leave you refreshed and rejuvenated!","geo":{"lat":34.864130266075,"lng":-111.76219940186},"guestType":"normal","included":[],"medias":[{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/519cc7783e269e7f0c000049\/519cc7d43e269e770b000060.jpg","type":"photo","id":"519cc7d43e269e770b000060"}],"name":"1 Hour Energy Healing","notIncluded":[],"other":"","photo":{"src":"\/uploads\/images\/experiences\/519cc7783e269e7f0c000049\/519cc7d43e269e770b000060.jpg","type":"photo","id":"519cc7d43e269e770b000060"},"price":85,"priceType":"person","reviewed":false,"schedules":[{"departure":"varies","repeat":"weekly","days":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6],"end":"2013-06-16","priceDelta":0,"id":"51a6d62e3e269e2b15000064"}],"seller":{"id":"519bd2313e269ed20d000014"},"updated":"2013-05-30T04:31:42+00:00","visible":true,"id":"519cc7783e269e7f0c000049"},{"category":"Trekking \/ Hiking","complete":true,"currency":"USD","desc":"2-hour tour to the creek.

The stretch starts off with a handful of Class II and III rapids as a warm-up. The first large rapid of the trip, Caldera, is where the nature of the run changes dramatically and goes from a tame meandering river to an impressive stretch of continuous class IV whitewater punctuated by a few noticeable class IV+ drops. From Caldera to Stateline Falls, the whitewater is non-stop. For those looking for a great full-day adventure that is fun and action-packed the Upper Klamath may be your trip of choice.\n\nDue to the active nature of this run, Upper Klamath trip participants should be in good physical shape and ready for a full day of paddling.
