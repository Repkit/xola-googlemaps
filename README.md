# Xola - Google Maps Mashup

## Intro

This project plots Xola's Experiences onto Google Maps, allowing you to see the various experiences availaible to you. This fetches the list of experiences from xola.com and uses that as a source to plot against a full-scale USA map.

A [demo](http://rushi.vishavadia.com/xola-googlemaps/) is available [here](http://rushi.vishavadia.com/xola-googlemaps/)
